# Template for Django-allauth tutorial (Part 5) at djangokatya.wordpress.com
Part of my relevant [series](https://djangokatya.wordpress.com/category/series/django-allauth/) dedicated to Django-allauth and it's configuration and customization.
Based on [Narrow Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.ru/docs/3.3.7/examples/jumbotron-narrow/) by Bootstrap.
Made to be compatible with Django 2.x and for [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth).
This particular repository is a follow-up to [Part 5 (Email Tempaltes)](https://djangokatya.wordpress.com/2020/09/03/django-allauth-tutorial-part-5-email-template/).
